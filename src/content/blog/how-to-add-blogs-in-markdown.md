## How to Publish a New Blog Post in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Create a `.md` File

Navigate to the `src/content/blog/` directory in your code editor and create a new file with a descriptive, URL-friendly name:

```
src/content/blog/my-new-water-article.md
```

The filename automatically becomes the URL slug:  
`https://your-domain.com/blog/my-new-water-article`

---

### Step 2: Add Frontmatter at the Top

Paste this YAML block at the very top of your file:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Descriptive Article Title Here"
description: "A 1-2 sentence compelling summary for Google SEO and card previews."
pubDate: 2026-05-01
heroImage: "/images/hero-plant.jpg"
category: "Industrial RO"
tags: ["RO Plants", "Gujarat", "Water Treatment"]
author: "Your Name or Aqua Shakti Team"
readingTime: "5 min read"
---
```

#### Frontmatter Fields Explained:
- `title` *(string, required)*: The main headline displayed on the article and page title.
- `description` *(string, required)*: Used for search engine meta descriptions and card excerpts.
- `pubDate` *(YYYY-MM-DD, required)*: Date of publication.
- `heroImage` *(string, optional)*: Image path (e.g. `/images/hero-plant.jpg` or any image in `public/images/`).
- `category` *(string, optional)*: Category pill badge (e.g. `Industrial RO`, `Wastewater Treatment`, `Commercial RO`, etc.).
- `tags` *(array of strings, optional)*: List of hashtags.
- `author` *(string, optional)*: Displayed alongside the publication date.
- `readingTime` *(string, optional)*: E.g. `5 min read`.

### Step 3: Write Your Content in Markdown

Underneath the closing `---`, simply write standard Markdown or GitHub Flavored Markdown:

```markdown
## 1. Introduction

Write your paragraphs naturally. Astro handles all formatting automatically!

## Build and Deploy

When you are ready, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

Astro compiles all markdown files into pre-rendered static HTML and generates an updated `/blog` index, RSS feed at `/rss.xml`, and an XML sitemap at `/sitemap-index.xml`.

Deploy the generated `dist/` directory to **GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages**, or any basic web hosting server with zero database overhead!
